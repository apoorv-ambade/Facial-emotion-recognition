This repository demonstrates a facial emotion recognition system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify facial expressions.

•  CNN.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the CNN model on the FER-2013 dataset.

•  Demo.zip: Contains a demo of the emotion recognition system, including sample data and pre-trained models.

•  README.md: Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

•  Readme.txt: Contains additional notes and instructions for setting up and running the project.

•  best_model.h5: The pre-trained CNN model file used for emotion classification.

•  image_input.py: Python script for testing the model on static images.

•  webcam.py: Python script for real-time emotion recognition using a webcam.


Instructions:
1. Save all files in one folder.
2. Run image_input.py for image input
3. run webcam.py for video input
